Radon-Transform_Schultz-Gu
==========================

We present two Matlab-based routines, Radon_inverse and Radon_forward, that perform discrete inverse and forward Radon transforms. These frequency-based methods offer the user flexible choices among multiple regularization methods and path functions. They are designed for simplicity and flexibility, and the Matlab foundation ensures portability between platforms. Both Radon_inverse and Radon_forward could be readily adapted or modified for a broad range of geophysical applications.
